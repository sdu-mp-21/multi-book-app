# Multi book App
We all know there are a lot of online book reading apps out there now, without the need for a physical copy. Our project is similar and at the same time different from typical online libraries. The fact that in online libraries you just read books, manga, listen to audio recordings, watch videos. And we decided to combine all this and add new features.


# What problem does our program solve?
Quick search of any format. Since we decided to combine all formats into one.\
Ability to convert to any format

# Book -> Manga
# Book -> Video
# Book -> Audio
